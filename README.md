# API

This is a scaffold code for a FastAPI project. The project has the following files:

- `app/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that tells Python that the `app` directory should be considered a package.
- `app/main.py`: This file is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the FastAPI app and sets up middleware and routes.
- `app/models/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that tells Python that the `models` directory should be considered a package.
- `app/routes/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that tells Python that the `routes` directory should be considered a package.
- `app/routes/example.py`: This file exports a FastAPI router instance that handles the `/example` route of the application. It defines a GET endpoint that returns a JSON response.
- `app/utils/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that tells Python that the `utils` directory should be considered a package.
- `tests/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that tells Python that the `tests` directory should be considered a package.
- `tests/test_example.py`: This file contains unit tests for the `/example` endpoint defined in `app/routes/example.py`.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies required by the project.
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project.

This project is intended to be used as a starting point for building FastAPI applications.
